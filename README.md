Technologies Used
--------------------

* **React**: For building reusable UI components
* **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and routing
* **Redux-like state management**: For managing global state
* **Jest and React Testing Library**: For unit testing
* **CSS Modules**: For styling and layout
* **SQLite3 database**: For storing quiz data
* **Custom Hooks**: For managing data fetching and state updates, promoting code reusability and modularity. 
* **Prisma (ORM tool)**: For interacting with the database, providing a powerful and flexible way to define the database schema and perform 
  CRUD operations.

 Clean Code Techniques
-----------------------

* **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**: Each component has a single responsibility
* **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**: State is managed centrally and updated predictably
* **Functional Programming**: Components are written as pure functions where possible
* **Type Safety**: TypeScript is used to ensure type safety and catch errors early
